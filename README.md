# Real Time intelligent Plate Tracking System(RTIPT)

## Overview

This project implements an AI-powered system for real-time detection and recognition of vehicle number plates. It aims to streamline traffic management, enhance security, and provide efficient automated services such as toll collection and parking management.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Detects and recognizes vehicle number plates in real-time from live video streams or static images.
- **Accurate Recognition**: Uses advanced OCR and machine learning models to accurately read number plates under various conditions.
- **Automated Toll Collection**: Integrates with toll management systems for seamless toll collection and payment processing.
- **Parking Management**: Facilitates automated entry and exit in parking facilities.
- **Data Logging**: Records and stores transaction details for reporting and analytics.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle high volumes of data and scale with additional cameras and locations.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js / Angular / Vue.js (for user interface)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express or Python with Flask/Django
- **Machine Learning**: OpenCV, TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch, YOLO, Tesseract OCR
- **Database**: MongoDB / MySQL / PostgreSQL
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS / Google Cloud / Azure
- **Security**: OAuth2 / JWT

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khandolly786/RTI-PT.git
   cd Real time Intelligent plate tracking system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   - **Frontend**:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```

   - **Backend**:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the required environment variables. Example:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   - **Frontend**:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```

   - **Backend**:
     ```bash

     python app.py
     ```

## Usage

1. **Access the Web Interface**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the user interface.

2. **Upload Images / Stream Video**
   - Use the interface to upload images or start a video stream for number plate detection and recognition.

3. **View Results**
   - The detected number plates and associated data will be displayed in real-time.
